# ThisKeyword

first Javascript engine loads the JS file and parses the code then it enters into Global Execution Context that is the default execution context where JavaScript engine enters first.
Whenever JS program is run a global object is created, global execution context is created along with that execution context and this keyword is created. Global obejct is created even before JS engine enters to the GEC(Global Execution Context) and what Global object contains it contains eventHandlers, history,ScrollX,Window object(in the case of browser), localStorage and more..\
After the parses of js code this is the default execution context where JS engine enters(Global Execution Context).Once the Js engine inside this global
execution context it creates 2 properties in the global memory by default the window object (in the case of browser) and this object.\
At the global level this keyword is equivalent to window object.\
***this===window***

Now let's understand How code is executed?
Global Execution Context is created and it is pushed into the callstack, Global Execution Context is like a big container where all code is executed it has 2 phases.\
1- Memory creation phase\
2- Code Execution phase
